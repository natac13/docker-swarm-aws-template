# Docker Swarm AWS Cloudformation Template

This template was created because I saw that Docker-for-aws does not support the new EC2 Instance Types; [reason was about Cloudstor](https://github.com/docker/for-aws/issues/184).

I wanted to also better understand what I am using to help control the costs with AWS. This lead me to created my own version of the Docker-for-aws template.
